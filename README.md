## Stock Price Movement Prediction Using StockTwits and Topic-Sentiment Neural Network
#### Senior Thesis in Department of Operations Research and Financial Engineering at Princeton University
#### Sep. 2015 - Apr. 2016
This thesis paper explores analyzing StockTwits data using Sentiment Analysis to extract market sentiment data, and investigating whether it allows more accurate prediction of future prices of stocks in that market. StockTwits text data is translated into distributions of topics and sentiments associated with each topic using Topic Sentiment Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm. This data is combined with various statistical data of historical prices of a stock to predict future prices. Finally the previous approach is compared with price prediction model without any sentiment data and discusses improvements and drawbacks.

## Genre Preference Trend Analysis Using Hidden Markov Model
#### Research Paper written in COS 513 (Foundations of Probabilistic Modeling) at Princeton University
#### Sep. 2015 - Dec. 2015
Using last.fm 1K dataset that has complete listening history of ~1000 users, this paper explores whether a person's genre preference trend can be be modeled by a Hidden Markov Model, and further investigates whether the model can predict genres that the user will listen to in the future.

## Dirichlet-GLM Model for Analyzing Fractional Data
#### Research Paper written in ORF 376 (Junior Independent Research) at Princeton University
#### Feb. 2015 - May 2015
Main goal of this paper is to develop a model that allows regression analysis on dataset with fractional response variables. In order to do this, theories of Generalized Linear Model is examined with Dirichlet distribution as the assumed distribution of response variables.

## An Analysis of Social Features Associated with Room Sales in Airbnb
#### Extended Abstract written during research internship at Advanced Institute of Convergence Technology (AICT) of Seoul National University
#### Jul. 2014 - Aug. 2014
This paper analyzes Airbnb room listings data to identify which features of the listings most strongly influence transactions. It was featured as an interactive poster entry in Computer-Supported Cooperative Work conference (CSCW) 2015.

## Unrecognized Yet Amazing World of Origami
#### Independent Research Project conducted in high school
#### Sep. 2010 - April 2011
A form of review paper that explores ties between mathematics and origami, this paper examines several geometric properties of origami that can be utilized to teach elementary mathematics concepts, such as solving polynomial equations, finding exponential limit, and constructing geometric figures. It also presents wide range of applications of origami from solar panel folding pattern that minimizes satellite launch fuel cost (which was recently used in James Web Space Telescope) to airbag folding design that allows it to deploy faster.
